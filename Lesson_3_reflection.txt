-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are collaborating with others.  Or to act a a store house for official version while local version could be working on a updated version (publishing).

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may not want other users or collaborators to see/use code that is still under development.  It could have bugs in it that you are still working out.

useful commands:

git push (name of remote repository) (local branch name to push)  - This will push the local branch you specify to GitHub
git pull (name of remote repository) (remote branch name to pull) - This will pull down the remote branch you specify locally.

-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches are a sequential list of commits which can be local or remote.  
Clones are a copy of repository (one or more branches).
Forks are a GitHub to GitHub clone.

useful commands:

git clone https://github.com/codem0nkey/recipes - how to clone a repository from a GitHub link to my laptop (note: all files are created based on current git bash folder location)
git remote -v   -  This will show you all currently setup remote repositories you can push or pull to/from.
