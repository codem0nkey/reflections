-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A git directory is created with no commits.

Note: use "git init" to create a git w/ no commits.  use "git status" to see a list of files that have changes since the last commit.  
In initial git w/ no commit, it lists all files in the directory.

-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediary step between the working directory that is not being tracked and a commit that is being tracked.  
This offers the flexibility to add exactly which files you want to include into the staging area and ultimately into a commit.


-How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can use "git diff" to check working dir against staging area.  
I can use "git diff --staged" to check staging area against most recent commit.
I can use git commit -m "message for commit" to create a new commit.

These help me track changes I am making and ensure I put what I like into a commit.
